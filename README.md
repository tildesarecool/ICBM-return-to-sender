# ICBM: return to sender
Inspired by Atari's Missile Command, but simpler and with a twist.

---

This is a generic learn-to-do-things project. Like an exercise by I set my own parameters.

My idea was to model *Missile Command*: lots of lines coming down from the top and player lines traveling upwards to the mouse click end point location.

The twist I'd like to implment is to have a role reversal after each round: after defending cities and silos from enemy ICBMs, the player is then in charge of sending ICBMs at enemy city targets and ICBMs.

I was also contemplating if that could work as a turn-based thing like the old game *Rampart*. 

This is just an exercise though. No idea if I'll ever implement anything.

Also, I need a better title.

So far I've created a *genericShapeTemplate* class that is supposed to make drawing various shapes easier. Or in this case almost entirely lines. There's also a class for rectangles and circles. They're there if I need them.

So I'm going to create a function or class that give the line a set of starting coordinates and one of the two end coordinates then the second coordinate I'll do the trust old += 3 to it and just see what happens. Something like that. I'm sure it'll work.
